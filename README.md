# Tic-Tac-Toe
Learning project first Tic Tac Toe game
The game is split into several different files and functions.
I used a 2d array as a map and several different loops to make sure it only takes in valid user inputs.
There are 2 game modes. a single player where the opponent is a rudimentary random number generator, and a 2 player mode.
The game keeps track of victory conditions via the Victory function.
